# Visual Design Fixes Summary

## Completed: October 24, 2025

All spotted design inconsistencies have been resolved to achieve award-winning visual perfection.

---

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Year Tag Typography Color** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Year tags displayed in black (`rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.9)`), not part of the color system.

**Solution:** 
- Changed to `#667080` (refined gray from typography system)
- Removed text-shadow for cleaner appearance
- Maintains visual hierarchy while staying on-brand

**Location:** `.balanced-year-tag` in `globals.css` (line 11891)

---

### 2. **Project Name Visual Accessibility** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Project titles lacked sufficient contrast and visibility.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced color from `#4A5568` to `#2D3748` (darker charcoal)
- Added subtle text-shadow: `0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)` for depth
- Improved readability while maintaining elegance

**Location:** `.balanced-title` in `globals.css` (line 11947)

---

### 3. **Manual Project Navigation** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** No way to manually navigate between projects in the carousel.

**Solution:**
- Added sophisticated prev/next navigation buttons
- Elegant pill-shaped buttons with arrows and labels
- Hover effects with smooth animations
- Pauses auto-play when user takes control
- Mobile-responsive (shows only arrows on small screens)

**Locations:** 
- Component: `page.tsx` (lines 845-878)
- Styling: `globals.css` (lines 10895-10970)

**Features:**
- Glassmorphism effect with backdrop blur
- Grapefruit accent borders
- Arrow animation on hover
- Accessible with ARIA labels

---

### 4. **Project Gallery Heading Visibility** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Gallery title used `var(--vanilla-whisper)` (very light) - invisible on light backgrounds.

**Solution:**
- Changed to `#4A5568` (warm charcoal)
- Ensures visibility on any background
- Maintains visual hierarchy

**Location:** `.gallery-title` in `globals.css` (line 11329)

---

### 5. **Footer Text Alignment** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Footer texts not properly aligned vertically.

**Solution:**
- Added flex alignment to `.footer-copyright-landor`
- Added `align-items: center` to both copyright and legal sections
- Added consistent `line-height: 1.4` for uniform baseline alignment
- Ensures all footer elements sit on the same visual line

**Location:** `.footer-bottom-landor`, `.footer-copyright-landor`, `.footer-legal-landor` in `globals.css` (lines 14353-14386)

---

### 6. **Services Section Backgrounds** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Service cards had opaque white backgrounds (`var(--vanilla-whisper)`, `var(--vanilla-foundation)`) that looked disconnected from the section.

**Solution:**
- Changed card backgrounds to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03)` - barely visible
- Changed hover state to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06)`
- Changed expanded content to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.02)`
- Updated borders to use grapefruit system colors with transparency
- Improved shadows with grapefruit tints
- Cards now "breathe" with the section background
- Added subtle hover transform: `translateY(-2px)`

**Locations:**
- Card styling: `page.tsx` (lines 947-965)
- Expanded content: `page.tsx` (lines 1039-1043)

**Visual Impact:**
- Less cluttered appearance
- Better integration with section background gradient
- More sophisticated, less "boxy" feel
- Maintains readability while reducing visual weight

---

### 7. **Services Typography & Capitalization** ✅ Already Correct
**Review:** Service titles already use proper sentence case, not all-caps. Typography uses the established system with:
- `var(--font-architectural-display)` for titles
- `var(--font-architectural-body)` for content
- Proper color hierarchy: `#4A5568` (warm charcoal) for titles, `#667080` (refined gray) for body

**No changes needed** - already at award-winning standards.
